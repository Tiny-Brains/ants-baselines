"""Torch to a submittable artifact: ONNX, fp16 initializers, and the platform's own verdict.

The last step is not a check this repository invents. It shells out to `tinybrains check --json`,
which reads the graph the way admission reads it and runs the manifest on the evaluator a node runs
it on — so "does it fit its class" is answered against the same measurements the platform will make,
over the cartridge's own reference observations. What this module adds is the loop around that: build, measure, and refuse an artifact
that misses its class.

    python -m tb_baselines.export --class micro --weights runs/micro-bc/best.pt --out models/micro-bc

Every export writes three files beside the model: `manifest.json` (generated, never edited),
`metrics.json` (what the platform said), and `card.md` (what a person needs to reproduce it). The
card names the **engine digest**, because a baseline that cannot say which engine it was trained
against is a baseline nobody can reproduce. (It used to name an evaluator digest too; the evaluator
is datalogic now, and `tinybrains games` prints the version this binary links.)
