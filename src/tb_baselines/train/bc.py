"""Behaviour cloning: fit a class's network to the teacher's moves.

    python -m tb_baselines.train.bc --class micro --data data/teacher.jsonl.gz --epochs 6

This is the **class ladder**: one fixed teacher, distilled into five byte budgets, so the question
the competition actually asks — how much play fits in N bytes — gets a measured answer rather than
an argument. It is also the reliable half of the matrix. Self-play RL on Ants is sparse-reward,
long-horizon, multi-agent and fogged; imitation is none of those, and a ladder needs opponents
before it needs interesting ones.

## The loss is per ant, not per board

The network answers a dense `[batch, 5, rows, cols]` policy map and only the cells holding one of
this seat's ants mean anything. So the loss gathers those cells and takes cross-entropy against the
teacher's move there. Everywhere else is unconstrained, and deliberately: a board is 16,384 cells
and about 30 of them have an ant on, so training the empty cells toward anything would drown the
signal five hundred to one.

One consequence is worth knowing before reading a loss curve: **a batch is a variable number of
decisions**, because seats have different ant counts. The reported loss is per ant.

## What the labels look like, measured

Over 1.16 million decisions the teacher's moves are **W 25.6% / E 25.3% / S 24.3% / N 23.8% / hold
1.0%**. There is no class imbalance to correct: an ant almost always has somewhere to be, and the
four directions are near-uniform.

That near-uniformity is also why the first dataset was thrown away. It came from a teacher that
shuffled the directions before choosing, so two equidistant neighbours — the common case in open
ground — were a coin flip, and a quarter of the labels were not a function of the state at all.
Cross-entropy against a coin flip has a floor no capacity gets past, so the class ladder would have
been measuring the teacher's noise rather than each class's capacity. The teacher is deterministic
now; see `teacher.py`.

Accuracy is the quantity being minimised and not the quantity that matters. A network can agree with
the teacher four times in five and play far worse, because the fifth compounds over three hundred
turns. Play it.
