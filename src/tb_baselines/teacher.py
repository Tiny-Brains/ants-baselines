"""The scripted teacher: a potential field over the board, one BFS a turn.

**It is not a baseline and must never be shipped as one.** It is a *label source*. The whole point
of the class ladder is to take one fixed teacher and ask how much of it fits in 8 KiB, in 64 KiB, in
512 KiB — and that question is only meaningful if the teacher is the same for every class and if it
is a player rather than a network. Distilling a heuristic is also the fastest honest way to get a
ladder something to play against; `axon`'s untrained fixtures hold still and teach nobody anything.

It is a *player*, not a second engine. It reads the observation the protocol defines and answers a
move — the same thing a competitor's model does. It implements no rule: it never decides who dies,
what a hill is worth, or when a match ends. `ants/CLAUDE.md`'s prohibition is on a second
implementation of the *rules*, and this has none.

## How it plays

One multi-source BFS a turn, over the cells this seat knows are not water, from every target at
once: food, enemy hills, and the frontier of what has never been seen. Each ant then steps down the
resulting distance field. That is the classic Ants opening bot and it is deliberately ordinary —
the interesting question here is what a network retains of it, not how strong it is.

Three refinements, each of which changes the games it produces rather than its style:

* **Targets are weighted by a head start**, not by a multiplier. Food seeds the queue at distance 0,
  an enemy hill at `-hill_lead`, so hills win ties out to that many steps. A multiplier on a
  distance field would break the BFS's monotonicity and is the usual bug here.
* **No two ants take one square.** They would both die (`ants/src/turn.rs`: every ant finishing on a
  shared square dies, your own included), which is the single cheapest way to lose a colony.
* **Nothing is random.** Given a seed and an engine the teacher is a pure function of the
  observation, and that is not tidiness — it is what makes it imitable at all. See below.

## Determinism is a requirement, not a nicety

The first version shuffled the four directions before choosing, to break ties without a directional
bias, and sent a quarter of its ants scouting at random. Both looked harmless and neither was:
measured over 1.16 million decisions the labels came out **W 25.6% / E 25.3% / S 24.3% / N 23.8% /
hold 1.0%** — almost exactly uniform, because in open ground two of the four neighbours are usually
equidistant from a far target and the choice between them was a coin flip.

A label that is not a function of the state cannot be learned from. Imitation accuracy has a ceiling
somewhere near the fraction of decisions that were not coin flips, and no amount of capacity gets
past it — so a class ladder built on that dataset would be measuring the teacher's noise floor
rather than the class's capacity.

So ties break in a fixed direction order, and the random scouting is gone: the frontier is already
seeded into the flood, so an ant with nowhere better to go walks toward what it has not seen
*because the field says so*. The directional bias in a genuine tie is real and is the right trade —
it is deterministic, so a network can learn it exactly.

        Unseen cells are passable *and* are targets: that is what makes one field drive foraging and
        exploration together, and why a colony with nothing in sight still spreads out rather than
        stalling into `idle_food`.

        **A numpy wavefront, not a queue.** The Python BFS this replaces was 93% of the training
        loop after `dilate` was fixed -- 11.6 million deque operations in a two-minute profile,
        because seeding the frontier makes almost every cell of the board a target. Expanding the
        whole ring at once is the same flood in `max_depth` array operations instead of one Python
        iteration per cell visited.

        Levels are offset so the earliest seed is 0: an enemy hill starts at 0, food at `hill_lead`,
        the frontier two later. Only differences are ever compared, so the offset is free -- and a
        head start is the right way to prefer a target, where a multiplier on a distance field
