"""A client for `tinybrains env`: the cartridge as a batched training environment.

One subprocess, JSON Lines both ways, and the rule that makes it safe: **actions are positionally
aligned with the seats the last call returned**. That is the game protocol's own rule, and it holds
here because a training env never forfeits a seat, so every live seat is played every turn.

    env = Env(waves=4, matches_per_wave=16, max_turns=300, seed=1)
    step = env.reset()
    while True:
        orders = my_policy(step.boards)          # [live, planes, rows, cols] -> [live] strings
        step = env.step(orders)

`Step.boards` is already encoded by `planes.encode` — the same function
`tests/test_adapter_conformance.py` proves equal to `adapter.json`. `Step.observations` is the raw
JSON beside it, because reward is computed from the game and not from the tensor.

## What this is not

It is not the referee. There is no turn deadline, no strike ceiling, no forfeit and no adapter
evaluation here, so a policy that trains happily can still fail at play. `tinybrains check` and a
real `tinybrains <match>` are the gates; see `eval.py`.
