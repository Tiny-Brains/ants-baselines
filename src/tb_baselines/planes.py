"""The observation encoding: one spec, rendered twice.

**This module exists to make train/serve skew impossible to have quietly.** A competitor who trains
in Python encodes each observation twice — once in `adapter.json`, which is what the ladder runs,
and once in numpy, which is what the optimiser sees. Two implementations of one encoding is the
classic way to ship a model that scores worse in the arena than it did in training, and the failure
is silent: both halves work, they just disagree.

So the planes are declared once, here, and each declaration carries **both** renderings side by
side: the JSONLogic fragment that goes into `adapter.json`, and the numpy function the trainer
calls. `tests/test_adapter_conformance.py` then runs the real evaluator — `tinybrains adapt`, which
is Axon's own dialect interpreter — over the cartridge's reference observations and asserts the two
agree element for element. Proximity makes them easy to keep in step; the test is what proves it.

## The planes

Six of these are the reference adapter's, unchanged, because they are proven and cheap. The seventh
is the visibility mask `axon/docs/dialect.md` §4 added `tb.dilate` for: without it a model cannot
tell *known empty* from *never seen*, since `water` reports 0 for both.

Owners are relative to the observer — you are always 0 — which is what makes `hills` splittable at
all. That was fixed in engine `sha256:f17b51b6c92b`; under an older engine these two planes are
swapped for seat 1 of every match.
